**Overview**
This project is a Honeypot-based system integrated with a Machine Learning Detection Framework to defend IoT-based environments from botnet DDoS attacks. 
The system simulates an IoT-based food quality monitoring system, where it monitors and traps potential malicious activity, particularly Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. 
The project aims to enhance security through proactive detection using honeypots, and machine learning models.

**System Architecture**
Sensing Layer: Contains Gas, Temperature, and Light sensors that simulate a food quality monitoring system.
Processing Layer: Data is processed and analyzed by the Microcontroller Unit (MCU).
Communication Layer: Uses a Wi-Fi module for data transmission between the sensors and the server.
Detection Framework: Uses machine learning algorithms to detect abnormal patterns in the data indicative of DDoS attacks.
